    "# Solving Sudoku Puzzles\n",
    "## Assignment Preamble\n",
    "Please ensure you carefully read all of the details and instructions on the assignment page, this section, and the rest of the notebook. If anything is unclear at any time please post on the forum or ask a tutor well in advance of the assignment deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to all of the instructions in the body of the assignment below, you must also follow the following technical instructions for all assignments in this unit. *Failure to do so may result in a grade of zero.*\n",
    "* [At the bottom of the page](#Submission-Test) is some code which checks you meet the submission requirements. You **must** ensure that this runs correctly before submission.\n",
    "* Do not modify or delete any of the cells that are marked as test cells, even if they appear to be empty.\n",
    "* Do not duplicate any cells in the notebook – this can break the marking script. Instead, insert a new cell (e.g. from the menu) and copy across any contents as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to save and backup your work regularly, and double-check you are submitting the correct version.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the primary reference for your submission. You may write code in separate `.py` files but it must be clearly imported into the notebook so that it runs without needing to reference those files, and you must explain clearly what functionality is contained in those files (through comments, markdown cells, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, **the work you submit for this assignment must be entirely your own.** Do not copy or work with other students. Do not copy answers that you find online. These assignments are designed to help improve your understanding first and foremost – the process of doing the assignment is part of *learning*. They are also used to assess your ability, and so you must uphold academic integrity. Submitting plagiarised work risks your entire place on your degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The pass mark for this assignment is 40%.** We expect that students, on average, will be able to produce a submission which gets a mark between 50-70% within the normal workload allocation for the unit, but this will vary depending on individual backgrounds. Please ask for help if you are struggling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be writing an agent that can solve sudoku puzzles. You should be familiar with sudoku puzzles from the unit material. You are given a 9x9 grid with some fixed values. To solve the puzzle, the objective is to fill the empty cells of the grid such that the numbers 1 to 9 appear exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 block of the grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a sample puzzle along with its solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/sudoku.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the this part of the assignment you will need to submit the implementation for an agent which can solve sudoku puzzles – this notebook:\n",
    " * You can use any algorithm you like, from the unit material or otherwise\n",
    " * Your code will be subject to automated testing, from which grades will be assigned based on whether it can solve sudokus of varying difficulty\n",
    " * To get a high grade on this assignment, the speed of your code will also be a factor – the quicker the better\n",
    " * There are some sample tests included below, make sure your code is compatible with the format of these tests\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice of Algorithm\n",
    "The choice of algorithm to solve sudoku puzzles is up to you. We expect you will use search techniques from the unit, but you could make something up yourself, or do some independent research to find something else. You will need to evaluate and balance the trade-off between how well suited you think the algorithm is and how difficult it is to write, but there is some advice below.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest you implement *constraint satisfaction* as it is described in the unit material. You can use the code you have previously been given as a guide. A good implementation of a backtracking depth-first search with constraint propagation should be sufficient to get a good grade in the automated tests (roughly 60-70%).\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also write a successful agent that uses the other search techniques you have seen in the unit so far: basic search, heuristic search, or local search. You may find these easier to implement, though they may perform less well. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get a high grade on this assignment will require a particularly efficient implementation of constraint satisfaction, or something which goes beyond the material we have presented. *This is left unguided and is not factored into the unit workload estimates.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to implement more than one algorithm, please feel free to include your code and write about it in part two (report), but only the code in this notebook will be used in the automated testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Sudoku Puzzles\n",
    "To get started, the cell below will load in some sample sudoku puzzles for you so you can see the format. There are sudokus provided of multiple difficulties (easier sudokus typically start with more digits provided). The cell below only loads the easiest, but there is another test cell lower in the notebook which will run your code against all of the provided puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sudoku is a 9x9 NumPy array of integers, where zero represents an empty square. Each difficulty comes with 15 sudokus, so when you load the file, it is stored in a 15x9x9 array."

    "### Testing Details\n",
    "There are four difficulties of sudoku provided: very easy, easy, medium, and hard. There are 15 sample sudokus in each category, with solutions as well. Difficulty was determined using reference solvers, but your code may vary; it is conceivable that your code will find some sudokus much easier or harder within a given category, or even between categories.\n",

    "When we test your code, we will firstly test it on the *same* very easy puzzles that you have been given. Then we will test it on additional *hidden* sudokus from each difficulty in turn, easy and up. Grades are awarded based on whether your code can solve the puzzles. For high grades on the hard puzzles, execution time will also be a factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "All puzzles must take under 30 seconds each on the test machine to count as successful, but you should be aiming for an average of under a second per puzzle. Hardware varies, but all tests will take place on the same modern desktop machine. Our ‘standard constraint satisfaction’ implementation takes about 0.001 seconds per puzzle for the very easy category, but struggles to solve some of the hard puzzles within the time limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "***The hard sudokus are labelled as hard for a reason.*** We expect most submissions will not be able to solve them in a reasonable length of time. Use the stop button (■) on the toolbar if you need to terminate your code because it is taking too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to improve the performance of your code is through a detailed understanding and smart choice of AI algorithms. This assignment is ***not*** meant to test your ability to write multi-threaded code or any other kind of high-performance code optimisations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test Cell\n",
    "The following code will run your solution over the provided sudoku puzzles. To enable it, set the constant `SKIP_TESTS` to `False`. If you fail any tests of one difficulty, the code will stop, but you can modify this behaviour if you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: you must set `SKIP_TESTS` back to `True` before submitting this file!"
